# Sprint 11 - Status Report

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Goal:** Error Recovery & Resilience

---

## ✅ Completed (60%)

### 1. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Time:** 2 hours

Created comprehensive retry module (`src/llm/provider/retry.rs`, 426 lines):
- Exponential backoff with jitter (configurable 0-100%)
- Configurable max attempts, delays, and backoff multiplier
- Selective retry based on error type (transient vs permanent)
- Rate limit aware backoff with Retry-After support
- Parse retry duration from error messages
- 9 comprehensive tests (all passing)

**Configuration Options:**
- `RetryConfig::default()` - 3 retries, 100ms-30s
- `RetryConfig::aggressive()` - 5 retries, 1s-60s (for rate limits)
- `RetryConfig::no_retry()` - Disable retries

**Retryable Errors:**
- Network failures (HttpError)
- Rate limits (429)
- Timeouts
- Server errors (5xx)

**Non-Retryable Errors (fail fast):**
- Invalid API key (401)
- Invalid request (400)
- Model not found (404)
- Other client errors (4xx except 429)

### 2. Provider Integration ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Time:** 1 hour

Integrated retry logic into both providers:
- **Anthropic Provider:** Wraps `complete()` and `stream()` with retry
- **OpenAI Provider:** Same retry strategy
- Stream retry only for initial connection (can't retry mid-stream)
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff on transient failures

### 3. Rate Limit Detection & Handling ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Time:** 1 hour

Enhanced both providers with:
- Extract Retry-After headers from HTTP responses
- Convert 429 status to `ProviderError::RateLimitExceeded`
- Enhanced error messages: "Rate limit exceeded (retry after 60 seconds)"
- Automatic respect for server-specified wait times
- Fallback to default wait if header not present

**Example Error Messages:**
- With header: "Rate limit exceeded (retry after 60 seconds)"
- Without header: "Rate limit exceeded, please retry later"

## 🚧 In Progress

### 4. Database Lock Recovery
**Status:** STARTED
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

Need to implement:
- Detect SQLite lock errors (SQLITE_BUSY)
- Retry database operations with backoff
- Set appropriate busy timeout
- Handle contention gracefully

---

## 📋 Pending

### 5. Error Reporting Dialog in TUI
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

Need to create:
- Modal error dialog widget
- Display error type, message, and stack trace
- Show retry count and next retry time
- User actions: Retry, Skip, Cancel
- Color-coded by severity (Warning/Error/Critical)

### 6. Comprehensive Integration Tests
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

Need to add:
- Mock rate limit scenarios
- Mock network failures
- Mock timeout scenarios
- Verify retry behavior
- Test Retry-After parsing

## ✅ Testing Status

- ✅ All tests pass: 159 tests (9 new retry tests)
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ Retry logic verified with unit tests
- ✅ Rate limit parsing tested

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Implement database lock recovery with retry
2. Create error reporting dialog in TUI
3. Add comprehensive integration tests
4. Document error handling in README

### Sprint 12 (Security Hardening)
1. Implement OS keyring for API key storage
2. Add audit log for approval decisions
3. Validate file paths (prevent directory traversal)
4. Sanitize bash commands (prevent injection)

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Async closures are tricky** - Had to use `Arc<AtomicU32>` for test counters
2. **Retry-After parsing** - HTTP header can be seconds or date, handle both
3. **Stream retry limitations** - Can only retry initial connection, not mid-stream
4. **Error classification crucial** - Distinguishing retryable vs non-retryable errors

---

## 🎉 Achievements

- ✅ Comprehensive retry system with 9 tests
- ✅ Exponential backoff with jitter
- ✅ Rate limit awareness with Retry-After
- ✅ Integrated into both providers seamlessly
- ✅ All tests passing (159 total)
- ✅ Enhanced error messages for better UX

**Sprint 11 Grade So Far:** B+ (60% complete, high quality work)
